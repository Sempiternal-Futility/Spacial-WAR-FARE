This file is contains a set of instructions for you to follow to "install" the game on linux


1- Downloading .NET 6.0
Go to this link (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-scripted-manual#scripted-install)  and download the script to install .NET.

Once you download the .sh file, run this on your terminal: sudo chmod +x ./dotnet-install.sh   
After running this commnand, run this other one (make sure you're not running it as root, or .NET will be installed on your root user directory): ./dotnet-install.sh --runtime dotnet --channel 6.0

This should install the .NET 6.0 Runtime on your system. To check if it installed properly, run the command "ls -a" on your home folder, you should see a folder called ".dotnet"



2- Running the game
Now that .NET is properly installed, run this command: "cd .dotnet"
Now run this other command: "dotnet (location of your game dll)"
This should open the game on a terminal emulator, all you have to do is run dotnet, the folder of your game, and the game dll

But we can make this process simpler, by adding ".dotnet" to the PATH



3- Adding .dotnet to PATH
Open your .bashrc file with whatever text editor you find the most comfortable, now type this command: "PATH=/home/user/.dotnet/:$PATH"
(Type that command without the quotes, and replace "user" with your username)

Now you should be able to use dotnet in whatever folder you are on!
But we can make this process even faster!




4- Creating alias to the game
Open your .bashrc file again, and type this command: "alias spacial='dotnet (location of your game dll)'"
Now instead of typing "(location of your game dll)" you replace it with the actual path to your game dll file, now whenever you type "spacial" inside a terminal emulator, you should jump straight into the game!

(Remember to have your terminal emulator in fullscreen / maximized, or the game will have visual issues!!!)
